# ebpfRootkit
Project Name: eBPFRootkit

Description:

eBPFRootkit is an experimental open-source project that explores the dual-edged nature of extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology by demonstrating how it can be leveraged to build stealthy, kernel-level rootkits. Designed for security research and defensive analysis, this project aims to shed light on modern Linux kernel vulnerabilities and the potential misuse of eBPF for advanced persistence, privilege escalation, and covert operations.

Key Features:

Process & File Hiding: Conceal specific processes or files from user-space tools.
Network Traffic Redirection: Manipulate packet flows transparently at the kernel level.
System Call Hooking: Intercept and modify kernel syscalls for behavioral manipulation.
Anti-Forensics: Evade common detection mechanisms (e.g., bypass eBPF verifier checks).
CO-RE (Compile Once, Run Everywhere): Compatible with multiple kernel versions via eBPF portability.
Use Cases:

üîç Security Research: Study eBPF-based attack vectors and kernel exploits.
üõ°Ô∏è Defensive Tooling: Develop detection rules for eBPF-powered threats.
üéØ Red Team/CTF Challenges: Simulate advanced adversarial techniques in controlled environments.

Technology Stack:

eBPF + CO-RE for kernel-space operations.
Libbpf for eBPF program loading and interaction.
LLVM/Clang for eBPF bytecode compilation.
